# Clojure-From-Groud-Up

## depedency:
* [JVM: ava Virtual Machine]: software which runs a Clojure program
* [JDK]
* [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/): Leiningen automatically handles
installing Clojure, finding libraries from the internet, and building and running your programs. 


## Prereq:
* For emacs users:set up [cider:The Clojure Interactive Development Environment that Rocks for Emacs]( https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider), to prevent undesired server error from `lein repl` command.

## Goal
* This repository serves as reference from tutorial [Learning Clojure from ground up](https://aphyr.com/posts/301-clojure-from-the-ground-up-welcome)
* Create some live example for defining effcient React components using plain ClojureScript(Clojure-to-Js compiler) functions and data.
